## Purpose

This document defines the automated quality gates for the master template. Continuous integration detects regressions in shared tooling, feature modules, profile generation, PostgreSQL integration, and production web builds before a change reaches `main`.

## Scope

The workflows under `.github/workflows/` run for pull requests and pushes to `main`. They validate the repository and temporary generated projects. Deployment, publishing, signing, release creation, and production database operations are outside this CI baseline.

## Local and CI equivalence

GitHub Actions orchestrates the same public interface used by developers:

```text
GitHub Actions
      |
      v
python tools/control.py
      |
      +-- install
      +-- doctor / config doctor / tauri doctor
      +-- test --suite <name>
      +-- db upgrade
      +-- build web
```

Project behavior remains in `tools/control.py` and its modules. Workflow YAML is responsible only for runtime setup, dependency caches, temporary service containers, command ordering, and job boundaries.

The local baseline is:

```sh
python tools/control.py install
python tools/control.py doctor
python tools/control.py test --suite all
python tools/control.py build web
```

`test --suite all` reads `project-profile.toml`. Disabled features report `SKIP` and return success. Missing files or failed checks for enabled features report `FAIL` and return a non-zero exit code.

Tests that exercise generator capabilities outside a derived project's enabled feature set are skipped. The same tooling suite still runs in every generated project; only master-only source-completeness checks are excluded when the corresponding source modules were intentionally not scaffolded.

## Test levels

| Level | Coverage | Public command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core tests | Tooling, profiles, configuration, schema, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, frontend, Tauri, and Rust | `python tools/control.py test --suite <name>` |
| External service tests | PostgreSQL connectivity and Alembic migration | `python tools/control.py test --suite postgres`, `python tools/control.py db upgrade` |
| Generated project tests | Real scaffolds for every supported profile | `python tools/control.py init`, followed by generated-project commands |
| Build verification | TypeScript checking and Vite production bundling | `python tools/control.py build web` |

Playwright E2E remains an optional suite. It reports `SKIP` until a real E2E configuration and tests exist.

## Workflows

### Core CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` separates failures into four jobs:

| Check name | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Core / Tooling, Profiles & Configuration` | CLI, generator, profile, configuration, and workflow regression tests |
| `Core / Backend, Database & Schema` | JSON Schema, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy unit tests |
| `Core / Frontend & Web Build` | Vitest and a production Vite build |
| `Core / Tauri & Rust` | Tauri doctor, configuration validation, `cargo check`, and Rust tests |

The jobs are independent and run in parallel. Native installers are not produced.

### Profile Matrix

`.github/workflows/profiles.yml` generates `web-only`, `web-cloud`, `desktop-local`, `desktop-cloud`, and `full-platform` projects. Each matrix entry runs an initial structure doctor, dependency installation, a prepared-environment doctor, the profile-aware complete suite, and a production web build. Desktop entries also install Linux Tauri prerequisites, run Tauri doctor, and execute Cargo checks.

On Debian-family Linux runners, `tauri install` refreshes apt metadata before a non-interactive install. It uses the Tauri v2 WebKitGTK 4.1 dependency set and selects the release-appropriate FUSE 2 package name (`libfuse2` on Ubuntu 22.04 and `libfuse2t64` on Ubuntu 24.04 and newer). Missing required compile-time libraries make `tauri doctor` fail; AppImage-only helpers remain warnings during check-only CI.

The matrix uses `fail-fast: false`. One broken preset therefore does not hide the status of the other presets.

### PostgreSQL Integration

`.github/workflows/postgres.yml` starts PostgreSQL 16 as an isolated service container with test-only credentials and a `pg_isready` health check. No external database is contacted.

The integration job performs this sequence:

```text
fresh temporary database
        |
        v
config doctor
        |
        v
Alembic upgrade head
        |
        v
PostgreSQL integration test
```

The same workflow generates `web-cloud --with postgres`, then runs doctor, migration, the complete profile-aware suite, and the web build in that generated project. `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_TEST` point only to the job-local service.

Application startup never runs migrations. CI invokes `db upgrade` explicitly.

## Runtime versions

| Runtime | CI baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Python | 3.11 |
| Node.js | 20 |
| Rust | Stable toolchain |
| PostgreSQL | 16 service container for integration tests |

These values test the minimum versions documented by the template for Python and Node.js and the supported stable Rust channel.

The official setup and cache actions use their Node.js 24-based stable majors. This internal action runtime is independent of the project-level Node.js 20 baseline above.

## Dependency installation and caching

`control.py install` uses `npm ci` whenever `frontend/package-lock.json` exists and falls back to `npm install` only for projects without a lockfile. Cargo commands use `--locked` with `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`. Python keeps the existing requirements-file and virtual-environment strategy.

GitHub-hosted caches cover:

- pip downloads keyed by the relevant requirements files;
- npm downloads keyed by `frontend/package-lock.json`;
- Cargo registry, Git sources, and target output keyed by `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`.

Caches improve execution time but are never required for correctness.

## Permissions and secrets

Every workflow declares only `contents: read`. Pull requests from forks do not require repository secrets. PostgreSQL uses the temporary user, password, and database declared in workflow YAML; those values exist only inside an isolated CI run and are not production credentials.

The workflows do not use cloud credentials, signing material, deployment tokens, package publishing, releases, or write permissions. Commands must not print database URLs or other secret values. Each job runs `git diff --exit-code` to detect unintended changes to versioned files.

## Failure handling

Jobs use explicit timeouts. Pull-request concurrency cancels an older run after a newer commit arrives, while `main` runs are not cancelled. Independent jobs remain parallel so GitHub reports the failing subsystem directly.

`PASS`, `SKIP`, and `FAIL` have distinct meanings:

- `PASS`: the selected check ran and completed successfully.
- `SKIP`: the active profile disables the feature or an optional suite is not configured.
- `FAIL`: an enabled feature is incomplete, configuration is invalid, or the executed check failed.

A configured but unreachable `DATABASE_URL_TEST` is a failure, not a skip.

## Branch protection recommendation

Configure `main` branch protection after the workflows have completed stable repository runs. Require the actual checks shown by GitHub for:

- all four `Core / ...` jobs;
- all five `Profiles / ...` matrix jobs;
- `PostgreSQL / Integration & Migration`;
- `Profiles / web-cloud + postgres`.

Require pull requests and current branch status before merge. Do not grant test workflows deployment or bypass privileges.

## Acceptance evidence

Automated tests and CI output provide repeatable technical evidence. They do not replace feature acceptance:

```text
Automated tests + CI evidence + acceptance testing = feature acceptance
```

Reference relevant CI runs from an ATP when they support an acceptance decision.

## Verification

Run the local equivalents from the repository root:

```sh
python tools/control.py test --suite tools
python tools/control.py test --suite schema
python tools/control.py test --suite api
python tools/control.py test --suite database
python tools/control.py test --suite frontend
python tools/control.py test --suite tauri
python tools/control.py build web
```

PostgreSQL verification additionally requires a disposable test database through `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_TEST`.
